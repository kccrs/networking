# Networking Web Application

Networking is a critical skill, and it can get hard to keep track of everyone you meet when you’re getting established in a new industry. Build an app to help you organize all your contacts and, hey, maybe even do a little job stalking while you’re at it. As a user, I want a networking app that:

- At a minimum, allows me to record name, company, email, social media, and phone number of new contacts.
- Ideally, I can also add an image (like logo, avatar, biz card snap).
- Includes a toggle on/off “followup” indicator on each contact, which will save those contacts in a “followup” list for my quick reference.
- Permits multiple options for email, phone, and social media, and allows me to specify “primary” where applicable.
- Includes an option note field for each contact, so that I can write myself little reminders about how we met, and what we discussed.
